# A bit about me. 
I am a 35 year old career truck driver looking to make a switch. I have completed my first year of my diploma and am looking forward to the rest of my program. Upto this point I can not believe how much have I have learnt. If you want to collaborate send me an e mail @ pmacdonald15@gmail.com.
